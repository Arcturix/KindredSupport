        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Kindred ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> Kindred is designed with privacy as a core principle. All your data remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
        <p>All information you add to Kindred is stored locally on your device, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Family member information (names, birthdays, contact details)</li>
            <li>Photos and notes about family members</li>
            <li>Events and reminders</li>
            <li>Relationship connections</li>
            <li>Tags and personal notes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iCloud Sync (PRO Feature)</h3>
        <p>When you enable iCloud sync (PRO feature), your data is stored in your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to this data, and it is subject to Apple's iCloud privacy policies. This is entirely optional and controlled by you.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, we have no information to use. The app functions entirely with data stored locally on your device. When you use iCloud sync (PRO feature), your data is handled by Apple's iCloud service according to their privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is protected through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data stored locally</li>
            <li>Face ID/Touch ID protection for app access</li>
            <li>iOS Keychain integration for secure storage</li>
            <li>No data transmission to external servers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data because we do not collect any data. Your information remains entirely on your device unless you choose to use iCloud sync (PRO feature), in which case it's handled by Apple's iCloud service.</p>

        <h2>iCloud Integration</h2>
        <p>When you use iCloud sync:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is stored in your personal iCloud account</li>
            <li>Data is encrypted by Apple's iCloud security</li>
            <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time</li>
            <li>We do not have access to your iCloud data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access your personal information</li>
            <li>Correct inaccurate information</li>
            <li>Delete your account and data</li>
            <li>Opt out of certain data processing</li>
            <li>Export your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
